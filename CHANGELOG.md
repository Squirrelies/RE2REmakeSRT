### [Download 1.1.5.2 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1152-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-09)
* Enemy HP is now sorted by percentage. Enemies which have been damaged will show up at the top of the list to better help you see which enemies you're engaging.
* Raw IGT value is now hidden. You can show this value again by using the --Debug command-line argument. The human-readable IGT still shows by default.

### [Download 1.1.5.1 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1151-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-08)

### [Download 1.1.5.0 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1150-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-07)
* Added --Transparent which sets the background to be transparent.
* Added ScalingFactor=n which defines what the size of an inventory icon will be relative to the original size where n is a value between 0.0 and 1.0. The default value is 0.75 (75%).

Notes: Using --No-Titlebar --Always-On-Top --Transparent will allow the SRT to function LIKE an in-game overlay. It is not an overlay in technical terms but it will fit the request without using DirectX 2D drawing and additional custom code.

### [Download 1.1.4.3 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1143-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-06)
* Potential fix for inventory display bugs that were happening mid to late game and after auto-save loading/continuing.
* Initial code for --No-Titlebar and --Always-On-Top support. It works but there is no transparency yet so it is not ideal yet.

* Added resizing/scaling to the inventory icons. Set to 75% of the original size so the inventory doesn't take up so much screen space.

### [Download 1.1.1.0 Alpha](http://dudley.gg/squirrelies/re2/RE2REmakeSRT-1110-Alpha-Signed-Release.7z) (2019-02-03)
